# Palindrome Checker – Java

This project implements a palindrome checker in Java using multiple use cases (UC1–UC5), each demonstrating different programming concepts and data structures.

---

## UC1: Application Entry & Welcome Message
Displays application name and version at startup using the `main()` method and console output.

## UC2: Hardcoded Palindrome Check
Checks whether a predefined string is a palindrome and prints the result using conditional statements.

## UC3: Reverse String Comparison
Reverses a string using a loop and compares it with the original string to validate a palindrome.

## UC4: Character Array Based Palindrome Check
Converts a string to `char[]` and uses the two-pointer technique for efficient palindrome validation.

## UC5: Stack Based Palindrome Check
Uses a stack (LIFO) to reverse characters and compare them to check for a palindrome.
